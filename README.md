## Software side

### Installation

This repository comes with a pre-built library of the SDK located in `lib/` directory. This file is meant to be linked with programs written in C and compiled with [SDCC](https://sdcc.sourceforge.net) compiler.

The demos written in Z80 assembly, as well as the assembly "header" files, are meant to be assembled with z88dk's z80asm assembler. Check their [official Github page](https://github.com/z88dk/z88dk) for more information about how to install it.

To compile the examples, you will need to define the path to this current repository in the environment variable `ZVB_SDK_PATH`:

```
export ZVB_SDK_PATH=/path/to/Zeal-VideoBoard-SDK
```

### Compile from source

Although precompiled libraries are already available in the `lib/` directory, it is also possible to build them from source.

#### Using CMake

To build them with CMake, run the following commands:

```bash
cd lib
# Remove the existing libraries
rm *.lib
cmake ..
make
```

### Usage

The fastest way to test this library is to define the `ZVB_SDK_PATH` environment variable, and compile one of the example in `examples/` directory.

For the examples that are meant to be run on Zeal 8-bit OS, you will also need to define `ZOS_PATH` environment which should point to Zeal 8-bit OS source code directory.

If you plan on making your own program, you will first need to choose the language, C or Z80 assembly, with these differences:

* Using C, and SDCC compiler, you are able to use the pre-built library which contains several functions to setup the video mode, the tileset, the tilemap, etc.... It is also possible to directly communicate and write the video board registers thanks to the C header files from `include/`. **Please note that your program must run on Zeal 8-bit OS**
* Using Z80 assembly, and z88dk's z80asm assembler, you can write a program that can run either in Zeal 8-bit OS, or in a bare metal environment. There is currently no library or helper implemented for assembly, but there is a header file that documents and defines all the constants: [include/zvb_hardware_h.asm](include/zvb_hardware_h.asm)
If you plan on running your program on Zeal 8-bit Computer, you may need to use the MMU to map and unmap the video memory, check [the open source MMU header](https://github.com/Zeal8bit/Zeal-8-bit-OS/blob/main/target/zeal8bit/include/mmu_h.asm)

### API Reference

At the moment, this API reference is only referring to the C library as there is no assembly implementation.

* Graphics: this library defines functions to control the screen, set the color palettes, manipulate the tilesets and tilemaps. These functions are declared and documented in [`include/zvb_gfx.h`](include/zvb_gfx.h) header file.
* Sprites: this part of the GFX library manages the on-screen sprites, the API is declared and documented in [`include/zvb_sprite.h`](include/zvb_sprite.h) header file.
* CRC: this library manages the hardware CRC32 controller, the API is declared and documented in [`include/zvb_crc.h`](include/zvb_crc.h) header file.
* SPI: this library manages the hardware SPI controller, the API is declared and documented in [`include/zvb_spi.h`](include/zvb_spi.h) header file.
* Audio: this library manages the sound output, the API functions are declared and documented in [`include/zvb_sound.h`](include/zvb_sound.h) header file.
* Controller: TBD, library to manage input devices such as game controllers or joysticks.

### Code Examples

This repository presents graphic demos, written in assembly that can be run directly on Zeal 8-bit Computer without any OS, after compiling them, it is possible torun them directly from Zeal 8-bit Bootloader, via the `Load program from UART` option in the menu.

It is also possible to flash the binary directly to the NOR Flash, but this is more tedious and requires an external flasher.

For the snake game, the resulting `bin/snake.bin` file can then be transferred to Zeal 8-bit OS (or imported in the romdisk) and run via the command `./snake.bin`.

Please refer to the `README.md` file that are present in each example directory.
